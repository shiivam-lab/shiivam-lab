👋 Hi, I’m Shivam Pandya

I’m an Aspiring Data Analyst focused on turning raw data into clear, decision-ready insights. I enjoy building dashboards that answer real business questions, not just look good.

I work hands-on with Power BI, SQL, Excel, Python, DAX, Power Query, and Tableau, and I’m actively building job-ready projects that show how data moves from messy inputs to meaningful outcomes.

Before moving into data analytics, I’ve been freelancing in Digital Marketing, which gives me a strong business mindset. I understand metrics, performance tracking, and why insights matter. What this really means is I don’t just analyze data. I analyze it with context.

My current goal is simple: land a data analytics role where I can apply analytical thinking, visualization, and problem-solving to real-world datasets and business challenges.
